[[bootstrap:region]]
= Configuring a Region

A Region is required to store and retrieve data from the cache. `org.apache.geode.cache.Region` is an interface
extending `java.util.Map` and enables basic data access using familiar key-value semantics. The `Region` interface
is wired into application classes that require it so the actual Region type is decoupled from the programming model.
Typically, each Region is associated with one domain object, similar to a table in a relational database.

GemFire implements the following types of Regions:

* *REPLICATE* - Data is replicated across all cache members that define the Region. This provides very high
read performance but writes take longer to perform the replication.
* *PARTITION* - Data is partitioned into buckets (sharded) among cache members that define the Region. This provides
high read and write performance and is suitable for large data sets that are too big for a single node.
* *LOCAL* - Data only exists on the local node.
* *Client* - Technically, a client Region is a LOCAL Region that acts as a PROXY to a REPLICATE or PARTITION Region
hosted on cache servers in a cluster. It may hold data created or fetched locally. Alternately, it can be empty.
Local updates are synchronized to the cache server. Also, a client Region may subscribe to events in order to
stay up-to-date (synchronized) with changes originating from remote processes that access the same server Region.

For more information about the various Region types and their capabilities as well as configuration options,
please refer to Pivotal GemFire's documentation on
http://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/11/developing/region_options/region_types.html[Region Types].

[[bootstrap:region:lookup]]
== Using an externally configured Region

To reference Regions already configured in a GemFire native `cache.xml` file, use the `lookup-region` element.
Simply declare the target Region name with the `name` attribute.  For example, to declare a bean definition identified
as `ordersRegion` for an existing Region named `Orders`, you can use the following bean definition:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:lookup-region id="ordersRegion" name="Orders"/>
----

If `name` is not specified, the bean's `id` will be used as the name of the Region.
The example above becomes:

[source,xml]
----
<!-- lookup for a Region called 'Orders' -->
<gfe:lookup-region id="Orders"/>
----

CAUTION: If the Region does not exist, an initialization exception will be thrown. To configure new Regions,
proceed to the appropriate sections below.

In the previous examples, since no cache name was explicitly defined, the default naming convention (`gemfireCache`)
was used. Alternately, one can reference the cache bean with the `cache-ref` attribute:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:cache id="myCache"/>
<gfe:lookup-region id="ordersRegion" name="Orders" cache-ref="myCache"/>
----

`lookup-region` provides a simple way of retrieving existing, pre-configured Regions without exposing
the Region semantics or setup infrastructure.

[[bootstrap:region:lookup:auto]]
== Auto Region Lookup

"auto-lookup" allows all Regions defined in a GemFire native `cache.xml` file to be imported into a _Spring_
application context when using the`cache-xml-location` attribute on the `<gfe:cache>` element.

For instance, given a `cache.xml` file of...

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<cache xmlns="http://geode.apache.org/schema/cache"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://geode.apache.org/schema/cache http://geode.apache.org/schema/cache/cache-1.0.xsd"
    version="1.0">

  <region name="Parent" refid="REPLICATE">
    <region name="Child" refid="REPLICATE"/>
  </region>

</cache>
----

A developer may import the `cache.xml` file as follows...

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:cache cache-xml-location="cache.xml"/>
----

The developer may then use the `<gfe:lookup-region>` element (e.g. `<gfe:lookup-region id="Parent"/>`) to reference
specific Regions as beans in the _Spring_ context, or the user may choose to import all Regions defined in `cache.xml`
with:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:auto-region-lookup/>
----

_Spring Data GemFire_ will automatically create beans for all GemFire Regions defined in `cache.xml` that have not been
explicitly added to the _Spring_ context with explicit `<gfe:lookup-region>` bean declarations.

It is important to realize that _Spring Data GemFire_ uses a _Spring_
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/BeanPostProcessor.html[BeanPostProcessor]
to post process the cache after it is both created and initialized to determine the Regions defined in GemFire to add
as beans in the _Spring_ application context.

You may inject these "auto-looked-up" Regions like any other bean defined in the _Spring_ application context with
1 exception; you may need to define a `depends-on` association with the '`gemfireCache`' bean as follows...

[source,java]
----
package example;

import ...

@Repository("appDao")
@DependsOn("gemfireCache")
public class ApplicationDao extends DaoSupport {

    @Resource(name = "Parent")
    private Region<?, ?> parent;

    @Resource(name = "/Parent/Child")
    private Region<?, ?> child;

    ...
}
----

The example above is applicable when using _Spring's_ `component-scan` functionality.

If you are declaring your components using _Spring_ XML config, then you would do...

[source,xml]
----
<bean class="example.ApplicationDao" depends-on="gemfireCache"/>
----

This ensures the GemFire cache and all the Regions defined in `cache.xml` get created before any components
with auto-wire references when using the new `<gfe:auto-region-lookup>` element.

[[bootstrap:region:overview]]
== Configuring Regions

_Spring Data GemFire_ provides comprehensive support for configuring any type of Region via the following elements:

* LOCAL Region: `<local-region>`
* PARTITION Region: `<partitioned-region>`
* REPLICATE Region: `<replicated-region>`
* Client Region: `<client-region>`

Please see the Pivotal GemFire documentation for a comprehensive description of
http://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/11/developing/region_options/region_types.html[Region Types].

[[bootstrap:region:attributes]]
=== Common Region Attributes

The following table lists attributes available for all Region types:

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
.Common Region Attributes

| See GemFire's http://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/cache/DataPolicy.html[Data Policy]
| The Region's Data Policy. Note, not all Data Policies are supported for every Region type.

| destroy
| boolean, default:false
| Determines whether the Region should be destroyed at shutdown.

| disk-store-ref

| Expected key type.

| load-factor
| float, default:.75
| Sets the initial parameters on the underlying java.util.ConcurrentHashMap used for storing Region entries.

| name
| Any valid Region name.
| The name of the Region. If not specified, it will assume the value of the `id` attribute (a.k.a. bean name).

| persistent
| *boolean, default:false
| Determines whether the Region will persist entries to local disk (Disk Store).

| shortcut
| See http://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/cache/RegionShortcut.html

|===

[[bootstrap:region:cache-listener]]
=== CacheListeners

`CacheListeners` are registered with a Region to handle Region events such as when entries are created, updated,
destroyed and so on. A `CacheListener` can be any bean that implements the
http://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/cache/CacheListener.html[`CacheListener`] interface.
A Region may have multiple listeners, declared using the `cache-listener` element nested in the containing
`*-region` element.

In the example below, there are two `CacheListener's` declared. The first references a named, top-level _Spring_ bean;
the second is an anonymous inner bean definition.

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:replicated-region id="regionWithListeners">
  <gfe:cache-listener>
    <!-- nested CacheListener bean reference -->
    <ref bean="myListener"/>
    <!-- nested CacheListener bean definition -->
    <bean class="org.example.app.geode.cache.AnotherSimpleCacheListener"/>
  </gfe:cache-listener>

  <bean id="myListener" class="org.example.app.geode.cache.SimpleCacheListener"/>
</gfe:replicated-region>
----

The following example uses an alternate form of the `cache-listener` element with the `ref` attribute.
This allows for more concise configuration when defining a single `CacheListener`. Note, the namespace only allows
a single `cache-listener` element so either the style above or below must be used.

WARNING: Using `ref` and a nested declaration in the `cache-listener` element is illegal. The two options are
mutually exclusive and using both in the same element will result in an exception.

[source,xml]
----
<beans>
  <gfe:replicated-region id="exampleReplicateRegionWithCacheListener">
    <gfe:cache-listener ref="myListener"/>
  </gfe:replicated-region>

  <bean id="myListener" class="example.CacheListener"/>
</beans>
----

.Bean Reference Conventions
[NOTE]
====
The `cache-listener` element is an example of a common pattern used in the namespace anywhere GemFire provides
a callback interface to be implemented in order to invoke custom code in response to Cache or Region events.
Using _Spring's_ IoC container, the implementation is a standard _Spring_ bean. In order to simplify the configuration,
the schema allows a single occurrence of the `cache-listener` element, but it may contain nested bean references
and inner bean definitions in any combination if multiple instances are permitted. The convention is to use
the singular form (i.e., `cache-listener` vs `cache-listeners`) reflecting that the most common scenario will in fact
be a single instance. We have already seen examples of this pattern in the <<bootstrap:cache:advanced,advanced cache>>
configuration example.
====

[[bootstrap:region:cache-loaders-writers]]
=== CacheLoaders and CacheWriters

Similar to `cache-listener`, the namespace provides `cache-loader` and `cache-writer` elements to register
these GemFire components respectively for a Region.

A `CacheLoader` is invoked on a cache miss to allow an entry to be loaded from an external data source, such as a
database.  A `CacheWriter` is invoked before an entry is created or updated, intended for synchronizing to
an external data source. The difference is GemFire only supports at most a single instance `CacheLoader` and `CacheWriter`
per Region. However, either declaration style may be used.

Example:

[source,xml]
----
<beans>
  <gfe:replicated-region id="exampleReplicateRegionWithCacheLoaderAndCacheWriter">
    <gfe:cache-loader ref="myLoader"/>
    <gfe:cache-writer>
      <bean class="example.CacheWriter"/>
    </gfe:cache-writer>
  </gfe:replicated-region>

  <bean id="myLoader" class="example.CacheLoader">
    <property name="dataSource" ref="mySqlDataSource"/>
  </bean>

  <!-- DataSource bean definition -->
</beans>
----

See http://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/cache/CacheLoader.html[`CacheLoader`]
and http://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/cache/CacheWriter.html[`CacheWriter`]
in the Pivotal GemFire documentation for more details.

[[bootstrap:region:compression]]
== Compression

GemFire Regions may also be compressed in order to reduce JVM memory consumption and pressure to possibly avoid
stop the world GCs.  When you enable compression for a Region, all values stored in the Region, in-memory
are compressed while keys and indexes remain uncompressed.  New values are compressed when put into Region
and all values are decompressed automatically when read back from the Region.  Values are not compressed when
persisted to disk or when sent over the wire to other peer members or clients.

Example:

[source,xml]
----
<beans>
  <gfe:replicated-region id="exampleReplicateRegionWithCompression">
    <gfe:compressor>
      <bean class="org.apache.geode.compression.SnappyCompressor"/>
    </gfe:compressor>
  </gfe:replicated-region>
</beans>
----

Please refer to Pivotal GemFire's documentation for more information on
http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/geode/managing/region_compression/region_compression.html[Region Compression].

[[bootstrap:region:subregions]]
== Subregions

_Spring Data GemFire_ also supports Subregions, allowing Regions to be arranged in a hierarchical relationship.

For example, GemFire allows for a */Customer/Address* Region and a different */Employee/Address* Region. Additionally,
a Subregion may have it's own Subregions and its own configuration. A Subregion does not inherit attributes from
the parent Region. Regions types may be mixed and matched subject to GemFire constraints. A Subregion is naturally
declared as a child element of a Region. The Subregion's name attribute is the simple name. The above example
might be configured as:

[source,xml]
----
<beans>
  <gfe:replicated-region name="Customer">
    <gfe:replicated-region name="Address"/>
  </gfe:replicated-region>

  <gfe:replicated-region name="Employee">
    <gfe:replicated-region name="Address"/>
  </gfe:replicated-region>
</beans>
----

Note that the `Monospaced ([id])` attribute is not permitted for a Subregion. The Subregions will be created with
bean names */Customer/Address* and */Employee/Address*, respectively. So they may be injected using the full path name
into other application beans that need them, such as `GemfireTemplate`. The full path should also be used in
OQL query strings.

[[bootstrap:region:templates]]
== Region Templates

_Spring Data GemFire_ also supports Region Templates.  This feature allows developers to define common Region
configuration settings and attributes once and reuse the configuration among many Region bean definitions declared
in the _Spring_ application context.

_Spring Data GemFire_ includes 5 Region template tags in namespace:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
.Region Template Tags
|===
| Tag Name
| Description

| `<gfe:region-template>`
| Defines common, generic Region attributes; extends `regionType` in the namespace.

| `<gfe:local-region-template>`
| Defines common, 'Local' Region attributes; extends `localRegionType` in the namespace.

| `<gfe:partitioned-region-template>`
| Defines common, 'PARTITION' Region attributes; extends `partitionedRegionType` in the namespace.

| `<gfe:replicated-region-template>`
| Defines common, 'REPLICATE' Region attributes; extends `replicatedRegionType` in the namespace.

| `<gfe:client-region-template>`
| Defines common, 'Client' Region attributes; extends `clientRegionType` in the namespace.
|===

In addition to the tags, concrete `<gfe:*-region>` elements along with the abstract `<gfe:*-region-template>` elements
have a `template` attribute used to define the Region Template from which the Region will inherit its configuration.
Region Templates may even inherit from other Region Templates.

Here is an example of 1 possible configuration...

[source,xml]
----
<beans>
  <gfe:async-event-queue id="AEQ" persistent="false" parallel="false" dispatcher-threads="4">
    <gfe:async-event-listener>
      <bean class="example.AeqListener"/>
    </gfe:async-event-listener>
  </gfe:async-event-queue>

  <gfe:region-template id="BaseRegionTemplate" initial-capacity="51" load-factor="0.85" persistent="false" statistics="true"
      key-constraint="java.lang.Long" value-constraint="java.lang.String">
    <gfe:cache-listener>
      <bean class="example.CacheListenerOne"/>
      <bean class="example.CacheListenerTwo"/>
    </gfe:cache-listener>
    <gfe:entry-ttl timeout="600" action="DESTROY"/>
    <gfe:entry-tti timeout="300 action="INVLIDATE"/>
  </gfe:region-template>

  <gfe:region-template id="ExtendedRegionTemplate" template="BaseRegionTemplate" load-factor="0.55">
    <gfe:cache-loader>
      <bean class="example.CacheLoader"/>
    </gfe:cache-loader>
    <gfe:cache-writer>
      <bean class="example.CacheWriter"/>
    </gfe:cache-writer>
    <gfe:async-event-queue-ref bean="AEQ"/>
  </gfe:region-template>

  <gfe:partitioned-region-template id="PartitionRegionTemplate" template="ExtendedRegionTemplate"
      copies="1" load-factor="0.70" local-max-memory="1024" total-max-memory="16384" value-constraint="java.lang.Object">
    <gfe:partition-resolver>
      <bean class="example.PartitionResolver"/>
    </gfe:partition-resolver>
    <gfe:eviction type="ENTRY_COUNT" threshold="8192000" action="OVERFLOW_TO_DISK"/>
  </gfe:partitioned-region-template>

  <gfe:partitioned-region id="TemplateBasedPartitionRegion" template="PartitionRegionTemplate"
      copies="2" local-max-memory="8192" persistent="true" total-buckets="91"/>
</beans>
----

Region Templates work for Subregions as well.  Notice that 'TemplateBasedPartitionRegion'
extends 'PartitionRegionTemplate', which extends 'ExtendedRegionTemplate' that extends 'BaseRegionTemplate'.
Attributes and sub-elements defined in subsequent, inherited Region bean definitions override what is in the parent.

=== How Templating Works

_Spring Data GemFire_ applies Region Templates when the _Spring_ application context configuration meta-data is *parsed*,
and therefore, *must be declared in the order of inheritance*.  In other words, parent templates must be defined
before children.  This ensures the proper configuration is applied, especially when element attributes or sub-elements
are "overridden".

IMPORTANT: It is equally important to remember the Region types must only inherit from other similar typed Regions.
For instance, it is not possible for a `<gfe:replicated-region>` to inherit from a `<gfe:partitioned-region-template>`.

NOTE: Region Templates are single-inheritance.

[[bootstrap:region:regions-subregions-lookups-caution]]
=== Caution concerning Regions, Subregions and Lookups

Previously, one of the underlying properties of the `replicated-region`, `partitioned-region`, `local-region`
and `client-region` elements in the _Spring Data GemFire_ XML namespace was to perform a lookup first before
attempting to create a Region.  This was done in case the Region already existed, which would be the case
if the Region was defined in an imported GemFire native `cache.xml` configuration file.  Therefore, the lookup
was performed first to avoid any errors.  This was by design and subject to change.

This behavior has been altered and the default behavior is now to create the Region first.  If the Region
already exists, then the creation logic fails-fast and an appropriate exception is thrown.  However, much like the
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...` DDL syntax, the _Spring Data GemFire_ `<*-region>` namespace elements now includes
a `ignore-if-exists` attribute, which re-instates the old behavior by performing a lookup of an existing Region
identified by name, first.  If an existing Region by name is found and `ignore-if-exists` is set to `true`, then
the Region bean definition defined in _Spring_ config is ignored.

WARNING: The _Spring_ team highly recommends that the `replicated-region`, `partitioned-region`, `local-region`
and `client-region` namespace elements be strictly used for defining new Regions only. One problem that could arise
if the Regions defined by these elements already existed and the Region elements performed a lookup first is if
the developer defined different Region semantics and behaviors for eviction, expiration, subscription, etc in his/her
application config, then the Region definition may not match and could exhibit contrary behaviors to those required
by the application.  Even worse, the application developer may want to define the Region as a distributed Region
(e.g. PARTITION) but in fact the existing Region definition is LOCAL.

IMPORTANT: Recommended Practice - Only use `replicated-region`, `partitioned-region`, `local-region` and `client-region`
namespace elements to define new Regions.

Consider the following native GemFire `cache.xml` configuration file...

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<cache xmlns="http://geode.apache.org/schema/cache"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://geode.apache.org/schema/cache http://geode.apache.org/schema/cache/cache-1.0.xsd"
    version="1.0">

  <region name="Customers" refid="REPLICATE">
    <region name="Accounts" refid="REPLICATE">
      <region name="Orders" refid="REPLICATE">
        <region name="Items" refid="REPLICATE"/>
      </region>
    </region>
  </region>

</cache>
----

Also consider that you may have defined an application DAO as follows...

[source,java]
----
public class CustomerAccountDao extends GemDaoSupport {

    @Resource(name = "Customers/Accounts")
    private Region customersAccounts;

    ...
}
----

Here, we are injecting a reference to the `Customers/Accounts` Region in our application DAO. As such, it is
not uncommon for a developer to define beans for all or even some of these Regions in _Spring_ XML configuration
meta-data as follows...

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:gfe="http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
         http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
         http://www.springframework.org/schema/geode http://www.springframework.org/schema/gemfire/spring-geode.xsd
">

  <gfe:cache cache-xml-location="classpath:cache.xml"/>

  <gfe:lookup-region name="Customers/Accounts"/>
  <gfe:lookup-region name="Customers/Accounts/Orders"/>

</beans>
----

The `Customers/Accounts` and `Customers/Accounts/Orders` Regions are referenced as beans in the _Spring_
application context as "Customers/Accounts" and "Customers/Accounts/Orders", respectively.  The nice thing about
using the `lookup-region` element and the corresponding syntax above is that it allows a developer
to reference a Subregion directly without unnecessarily defining a bean for the parent Region (i.e. `Customers`).

However, if now the developer changes his/her configuration meta-data syntax to using the nested format, like so...

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:lookup-region name="Customers">
  <gfe:lookup-region name="Accounts">
    <gfe:lookup-region name="Orders"/>
  </gfe:lookup-region>
</gfe:lookup-region>
----

Or, perhaps the developer erroneously chooses to use the top-level `replicated-region` element along with
the `ignore-if-exists` attribute set to perform a lookup first, as in...

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:replicated-region name="Customers" persistent="true" ignore-if-exists="true">
  <gfe:replicated-region name="Accounts" persistent="true" ignore-if-exists="true">
    <gfe:replicated-region name="Orders" persistent="true" ignore-if-exists="true"/>
  </gfe:replicated-region>
</gfe:replicated-region>
----

Then the Region beans defined in the _Spring_ application context will consist of the following:
`{ "Customers", "/Customers/Accounts", "/Customers/Accounts/Orders" }.` This means the dependency injected reference
above (i.e. `@Resource(name = "Customers/Accounts"))` is now broken since no bean with name "Customers/Accounts"
is actually defined.

GemFire is flexible in referencing both parent Regions and Subregions with or without the leading forward slash.
For example, the parent can be referenced as "/Customers" or "Customers" and the child as "/Customers/Accounts"
or just "Customers/Accounts". However, _Spring Data _GemFire is very specific when it comes to naming beans after Regions,
typically always using the forward slash (/) to represent Subregions (e.g. "/Customers/Accounts").

Therefore, it is recommended that users either use the nested `lookup-region` syntax as shown above,
or define direct references with a leading forward slash (/) like so...

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:lookup-region name="/Customers/Accounts"/>
<gfe:lookup-region name="/Customers/Accounts/Orders"/>
----

The example above where the nested `replicated-region` elements were used to reference the Subregions serves to
illustrate the problem stated earlier. Are the Customers, Accounts and Orders Regions/Subregions persistent or not?
Not, since the Regions were defined in the native GemFire `cache.xml` configuration file as `REPLICATES` and will exist
by the time the cache is initialized, or once the `<gfe:cache>` bean is processed.

[[bootstrap:region:eviction]]
== Data Eviction (with Overflow)

Based on various constraints, each Region can have an eviction policy in place for evicting data from memory.
Currently, in GemFire, eviction applies to the _Least Recently Used_ entry (also known as
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used[LRU]). Evicted entries are either destroyed
or paged to disk (referred to as *overflow* to disk).

_Spring Data GemFire_ supports all eviction policies (entry count, memory and heap usage) for PARTITION Regions,
REPLICATE Regions and client, local Regions using the nested `eviction` element.

For example, to configure a PARTITION Region to overflow to disk if the memory size exceeds more than 512 MB,
a developer would specify the following configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:partitioned-region id="examplePartitionRegionWithEviction">
  <gfe:eviction type="MEMORY_SIZE" threshold="512" action="OVERFLOW_TO_DISK"/>
</gfe:partitioned-region>
----

IMPORTANT: Replicas cannot use `local destroy` eviction since that would invalidate them.
See the GemFire docs for more information.

When configuring Regions for overflow, it is recommended to configure the storage through the `disk-store` element
for maximum efficiency.

For a detailed description of eviction policies, please refer to the GemFire documentation on
http://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/11/developing/eviction/chapter_overview.html[Eviction].

[[bootstrap:region:expiration]]
== Data Expiration

Pivotal GemFire allows you to control how long entries exist in the cache. Expiration is driven by elapsed time,
as opposed to Eviction, which is driven by the entry count or heap/memory usage. Once an entry expires
it may no longer be accessed from the cache.

GemFire supports the following Expiration types:

* *Time-to-Live (TTL)* - The amount of time in seconds that an object may remain in the cache after the last creation
or update. For entries, the counter is set to zero for create and put operations. Region counters are reset when
the Region is created and when an entry has its counter reset.
* *Idle Timeout (TTI)* - The amount of time in seconds that an object may remain in the cache after the last access.
The Idle Timeout counter for an object is reset any time its TTL counter is reset. In addition, an entry’s
_Idle Timeout_ counter is reset any time the entry is accessed through a get operation or a netSearch.
The _Idle Timeout_ counter for a Region is reset whenever the _Idle Timeout_ is reset for one of its entries.

Each of these may be applied to the Region itself or entries in the Region. _Spring Data GemFire_ provides `<region-ttl>`,
`<region-tti>`, `<entry-ttl>` and `<entry-tti>` Region child elements to specify timeout values and expiration actions.

For example:

[source,xml]
----

[[bootstrap:region:expiration:annotation]]
=== Annotation-based Data Expiration

With _Spring Data GemFire_, a developer has the ability to define Expiration policies and settings on individual
Region Entry values, or rather, application domain objects directly.  For instance, a developer might define Expiration
settings on a Session-based application domain object like so...

[source,java]
----
@Expiration(timeout = "1800", action = "INVALIDATE")
public class SessionBasedApplicationDomainObject {
  ...
}
----

In addition, a developer may also specify Expiration type specific settings on Region Entries using
`@IdleTimeoutExpiration` and `@TimeToLiveExpiration` annotations for Idle Timeout (TTI) and Time-to-Live (TTL)
Expiration, respectively...

[source,java]
----
@TimeToLiveExpiration(timeout = "3600", action = "LOCAL_DESTROY")
@IdleTimeoutExpiration(timeout = "1800", action = "LOCAL_INVALIDATE")
@Expiration(timeout = "1800", action = "INVALIDATE")
public class AnotherSessionBasedApplicationDomainObject {
  ...
}
----

Both `@IdleTimeoutExpiration` and `@TimeToLiveExpiration` take precedence over the generic `@Expiration` annotation
when more than one Expiration annotation type is specified, as shown above. Though, neither `@IdleTimeoutExpiration`
nor `@TimeToLiveExpiration` overrides the other; rather they may compliment each other when different Region Entry
Expiration types, such as TTL and TTI, are configured.

[NOTE]
====
All @Expiration-based annotations apply only to Region Entry values.  Expiration for a "Region" is not covered
by _Spring Data GemFire's_ Expiration annotation support.  However, Pivotal GemFire and _Spring Data GemFire_ do allow you
to set Region Expiration using the SDG XML namespace, like so...

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:*-region id="Example" persistent="false">
  <gfe:region-ttl timeout="600" action="DESTROY"/>
  <gfe:region-tti timeout="300" action="INVALIDATE"/>
</gfe:*-region>
----
====

_Spring Data GemFire's_ `@Expiration` annotation support is implemented with GemFire's
http://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/cache/CustomExpiry.html[`CustomExpiry`] interface.
Refer to GemFire's documentation on http://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/11/developing/expiration/configuring_data_expiration.html[Configuring Data Expiration]
for more details

The _Spring Data GemFire_ `AnnotationBasedExpiration` class (and `CustomExpiry` implementation) is responsible
for processing the SDG `@Expiration` annotations and applying the Expiration policy and settings appropriately
for Region Entry Expiration on request.

To use _Spring Data GemFire_ to configure specific GemFire Regions to appropriately apply the Expiration policy
and settings applied to your application domain objects annotated with `@Expiration`-based annotations, you must...

1. Define a bean in the _Spring_ `ApplicationContext` of type `AnnotationBasedExpiration` using the appropriate
constructor or one of the convenient factory methods.  When configuring Expiration for a specific Expiration type,
such as _Idle Timeout_ or _Time-to-Live_, then you should use one of the factory methods in the
`AnnotationBasedExpiration` class, like so...
+
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="ttlExpiration" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.expiration.AnnotationBasedExpiration"
      factory-method="forTimeToLive"/>

<gfe:partitioned-region id="Example" persistent="false">
    <gfe:custom-entry-ttl ref="ttlExpiration"/>
</gfe:partitioned-region>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To configure _Idle Timeout_ (TTI) Expiration instead, then you would of course use the `forIdleTimeout` factory method
along with the `<gfe:custom-entry-tti ref="ttiExpiration"/>` element to set TTI.
====

2. (optional) Annotate your application domain objects that will be stored in the Region with Expiration policies
and custom settings using one of _Spring Data GemFire's_ `@Expiration` annotations: `@Expiration`,
`@IdleTimeoutExpiration` and/or `@TimeToLiveExpiration`

3. (optional) In cases where particular application domain objects have not been annotated with _Spring Data GemFire's_
`@Expiration` annotations at all, but the GemFire Region is configured to use SDG's custom `AnnotationBasedExpiration`
class to determine the Expiration policy and settings for objects stored in the Region, then it is possible to set
"default" Expiration attributes on the `AnnotationBasedExpiration` bean by doing the following...

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="defaultExpirationAttributes" class="org.apache.geode.cache.ExpirationAttributes">
    <constructor-arg value="600"/>
    <constructor-arg value="#{T(org.apache.geode.cache.ExpirationAction).DESTROY}"/>
</bean>

<bean id="ttiExpiration" class="org.springframework.data.gemfire.expiration.AnnotationBasedExpiration"
      factory-method="forIdleTimeout">
    <constructor-arg ref="defaultExpirationAttributes"/>
</bean>

<gfe:partitioned-region id="Example" persistent="false">
    <gfe:custom-entry-tti ref="ttiExpiration"/>
</gfe:partitioned-region>
----

You may have noticed that _Spring Data GemFire's_ `@Expiration` annotations use a String as the attributes type rather
than, and perhaps more appropriately, being strongly typed, i.e. `int` for 'timeout' and SDG'S `ExpirationActionType`
for 'action'.  Why is that?

Well, enter one of _Spring Data GemFire's_ other features, leveraging _Spring's_ core infrastructure
for configuration convenience: _Property Placeholders_ and _Spring Expression Language_ (SpEL).

For instance, a developer can specify both the Expiration 'timeout' and 'action' using _Property Placeholders_
in the `@Expiration` annotation attributes...

[source,java]
----
@TimeToLiveExpiration(timeout = "${geode.region.entry.expiration.ttl.timeout}"
    action = "${geode.region.entry.expiration.ttl.action}")
public class ExampleApplicationDomainObject {
  ...
}
----

Then, in your _Spring_ XML config or in JavaConfig, you would declare the following beans...

[source,xml]
----
<util:properties id="expirationSettings">
  <prop key="geode.region.entry.expiration.ttl.timeout">600</prop>
  <prop key="geode.region.entry.expiration.ttl.action">INVALIDATE</prop>
  ...
</util:properties>

<context:property-placeholder properties-ref="expirationProperties"/>
----

This is both convenient when multiple application domain objects might share similar Expiration policies and settings,
or when you wish to externalize the configuration.

However, a developer may want more dynamic Expiration configuration determined by the state of the running system.
This is where the power of SpEL comes in and is the recommended approach, actually.  Not only can you refer to beans
in the _Spring_ context and access bean properties, invoke methods, etc, the values for Expiration 'timeout'
and 'action' can be strongly typed.  For example (building on the example above)...

[source,xml]
----
<util:properties id="expirationSettings">
  <prop key="geode.region.entry.expiration.ttl.timeout">600</prop>
  <prop key="geode.region.entry.expiration.ttl.action">#{T(org.springframework.data.gemfire.expiration.ExpirationActionType).DESTROY}</prop>
  <prop key="geode.region.entry.expiration.tti.action">#{T(org.apache.geode.cache.ExpirationAction).INVALIDATE}</prop>
  ...
</util:properties>

<context:property-placeholder properties-ref="expirationProperties"/>
----

Then, on your application domain object...

[source,java]
----
@TimeToLiveExpiration(timeout = "@expirationSettings['geode.region.entry.expiration.ttl.timeout']"
    action = "@expirationSetting['geode.region.entry.expiration.ttl.action']")
public class ExampleApplicationDomainObject {
  ...
}
----

You can imagine that the 'expirationSettings' bean could be a more interesting and useful object rather than a simple
instance of `java.util.Properties`. In this example, even the Properties (`expirationSettings`) uses SpEL to base
the action value on the actual Expiration action enumerated type leading to more quickly identified failures
if the types ever change.

All of this has been demonstrated and tested in the _Spring Data GemFire_ test suite, by way of example.  See the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-geode[source] for further details.

[[bootstrap:region:persistence]]
== Data Persistence

Regions can be persistent. GemFire ensures that all the data you put into a Region that is configured for persistence
will be written to disk in a way that is recoverable the next time you recreate the Region.  This allows data
to be recovered after machine or process failure, or even after an orderly shutdown and subsequent restart of
the GemFire data node.

To enable persistence with _Spring Data GemFire_, simply set the `persistent` attribute to `true` on
any of the `<*-region>` elements.  For example...

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:partitioned-region id="examplePersitentPartitionRegion" persistent="true"/>
----

Persistence may also be configured using the `data-policy` attribute; set the attribute's value to one of
http://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/cache/DataPolicy.html[GemFire's DataPolicy settings].
For example...

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:partitioned-region id="anotherExamplePersistentPartitionRegion" data-policy="PERSISTENT_PARTITION"/>
----

The `DataPolicy` must match the Region type and must also agree with the `persistent` attribute if also explicitly set.
An initialization exception will be thrown if the `persistent` attribute is set to `false` yet a persistent `DataPolicy`
was specified (e.g. PERSISTENT_REPLICATE, PERSISTENT_PARTITION).

When persisting Regions, it is recommended to configure the storage through the `disk-store` element
for maximum efficiency. The DiskStore is referenced using the `disk-store-ref` attribute. Additionally, the Region
may perform disk writes synchronously or asynchronously:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:partitioned-region id="yetAnotherExamplePersistentPartitionRegion" persistent="true"
    disk-store-ref="myDiskStore" disk-synchronous="true"/>
----

This is discussed further in <<bootstrap:diskstore>>

[[bootstrap:region:subscription]]
== Subscription Policy

GemFire allows configuration of http://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/11/developing/events/configure_p2p_event_messaging.html[peer-to-peer (P2P) event messaging]
to control the entry events that the Region will receive.  _Spring Data GemFire_ provides the `<gfe:subscription/>`
sub-element to set the subscription policy on REPLICATE and PARTITION Regions to either `ALL` or `CACHE_CONTENT`.

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:partitioned-region id="examplePartitionRegionWithCustomSubscription">
  <gfe:subscription type="CACHE_CONTENT"/>
</gfe:partitioned-region>
----

[[bootstrap:region:local]]
== Local Region

_Spring Data GemFire_ offers a dedicated `local-region` element for creating local Regions. Local Regions, as the name
implies, are standalone, meaning they do not share data with any other distributed system member. Other than that,
all common Region configuration options apply.

A minimal declaration looks as follows (again, the example relies on the _Spring Data GemFire_ namespace
naming conventions to wire the cache):

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:local-region id="exampleLocalRegion"/>
----

Here, a local Region is created (if one doesn't exist already). The name of the Region is the same as the bean id
(`myLocalRegion`) and the bean assumes the existence of a GemFire cache named `gemfireCache`.

[[bootstrap:region:replicate]]
== Replicated Region

One of the common Region types is a *REPLICATE* Region or *replica*. In short, when a Region is configured to be
a REPLICATE, every member that hosts the Region stores a copy of the Region's entries locally. Any update to
a REPLICATE Region is distributed to all copies of the Region. When a _replica_ is created, it goes through
an initialization stage in which it discovers other _replicas_ and automatically copies all the entries.
While one _replica_ is initializing you can still continue to use the other _replica_.

_Spring Data GemFire_ offers a `replicated-region` element. A minimal declaration looks as follows.
All common configuration options are available for REPLICATE Regions.

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:replicated-region id="exampleReplica"/>
----

Refer to GemFire's documentation on
http://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/11/developing/distributed_regions/chapter_overview.html[Distributed and Replicated Regions]
for more details.

[[bootstrap:region:partition]]
== Partitioned Region

Another Region type supported out-of-the-box by the _Spring Data GemFire_ namespace is the PARTITION Region.

To quote the GemFire docs:

"A partitioned region is a region where data is divided between peer servers hosting the region so that
each peer stores a subset of the data. When using a partitioned region, applications are presented with
a logical view of the region that looks like a single map containing all of the data in the region.
Reads or writes to this map are transparently routed to the peer that hosts the entry that is the target of
the operation. GemFire divides the domain of hashcodes into buckets. Each bucket is assigned to a specific peer,
but may be relocated at any time to another peer in order to improve the utilization of resources across the cluster."

A partition is created using the `partitioned-region` element. Its configuration options are similar to that of
the `replicated-region` plus the partition specific features such as the number of redundant copies,
total maximum memory, number of buckets, partition resolver and so on.

Below is a quick example on setting up a PARTITION Region with 2 redundant copies:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:partitioned-region id="examplePartitionRegion" copies="2" total-buckets="17">
  <gfe:partition-resolver>
    <bean class="example.PartitionResolver"/>
  </gfe:partition-resolver>
</gfe:partitioned-region>
----

Refer to GemFire's documentation on
http://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/11/developing/partitioned_regions/chapter_overview.html[Partitioned Regions]
for more details.

[[bootstrap:region:partition:attributes]]
=== Partitioned Region Attributes

The following table offers a quick overview of configuration options specific to PARTITION Regions.
These are in addition to the common Region configuration options described <<bootstrap:region:attributes, above>>.

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
.partitioned-region attributes
|===
| Name
| Values
| Description

| copies
| 0..4
| The number of copies for each partition for high-availability. By default, no copies are created
meaning there is no redundancy. Each copy provides extra backup at the expense of extra storage.

| colocated-with
| *valid region name*
| The name of the PARTITION Region with which this newly created PARTITION Region is collocated.

| local-max-memory
| *positive integer*
| The maximum amount of memory in megabytes used by the Region in *this* process.

| total-max-memory
| *any integer value*
| The maximum amount of memory in megabytes used by the Region in *all* processes.

| partition-listener
| *bean name*
| The name of the `PartitionListener` used by this Region, for handling partition events.

| partition-resolver
| *bean name*
| The name of the `PartitionResolver` used by this Region, for custom partitioning.

| recovery-delay
| *any long value*
| The delay in milliseconds that existing members will wait before satisfying redundancy after another member crashes.
-1 (the default) indicates that redundancy will not be recovered after a failure.

| startup-recovery-delay
| *any long value*
| The delay in milliseconds that new members will wait before satisfying redundancy.
-1 indicates that adding new members will not trigger redundancy recovery. The default is to recover redundancy
immediately when a new member is added.
|===

[[bootstrap:region:client]]
== Client Region

Pivotal GemFire supports various deployment topologies for managing and distributing data.  GemFire topologies is outside
the scope of this documentation.  However, to quickly recap, GemFire's supported topologies can be classified in short as:
_peer-to-peer_ (p2p), _client-server_, and _wide area network_ (WAN).  In the last two configurations, it is common
to declare *client* Regions which connect to a cache server.

_Spring Data GemFire_ offers dedicated support for such configuration through <<bootstrap:cache:client, client-cache>>,
`client-region` and `pool` elements.  As the names imply, the former defines a client Region while the latter defines
a Pool of connections to be used/shared by the various client Regions.

Below is a typical client Region configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<bean id="myListener" class="example.CacheListener"/>

<!-- client Region using the default SDG gemfirePool Pool -->
<gfe:client-region id="Example">
  <gfe:cache-listener ref="myListener"/>
</gfe:client-region>

<!-- client Region using its own dedicated Pool -->
<gfe:client-region id="AnotherExample" pool-name="myPool">
  <gfe:cache-listener ref="myListener"/>
</gfe:client-region>

<!-- Pool definition -->
<gfe:pool id="myPool" subscription-enabled="true">
  <gfe:locator host="remoteHost" port="12345"/>
</gfe:pool>
----

As with the other Region types, `client-region` supports `CacheListener``s` as well as a `CacheLoader` and `CacheWriter`.
It also requires a connection `Pool` for connecting to either a set of Locators or Servers.
Each client Region can have its own Pool or they can share the same one.

NOTE: In the above example, the Pool is configured with `locator`. A Locator is a separate process used to discover
cache servers and peer data members in the distributed system and are recommended for production systems. It is also
possible to configure the Pool to connect directly to one or more cache servers using the `server` element.

For a full list of options to set on the client and especially on the Pool, please refer to
the _Spring Data GemFire_ schema (<<appendix-schema>>) and GemFire's documentation on
http://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/11/topologies_and_comm/cs_configuration/chapter_overview.html[Client/Server Configuration].

[[bootstrap:region:client:interests]]
=== Client Interests

To minimize network traffic, each client can separately define its own 'interests' policies, indicating to GemFire
the data it actually requires. In _Spring Data GemFire_, 'interests' can be defined for each client Region separately.
Both Key-based and Regular Expression-based interest types are supported.

For example:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:client-region id="Example" pool-name="myPool">
    <gfe:key-interest durable="true" result-policy="KEYS">
        <bean id="key" class="java.lang.String">
             <constructor-arg value="someKey"/>
        </bean>
    </gfe:key-interest>
    <gfe:regex-interest pattern=".*" receive-values="false"/>
</gfe:client-region>
----

A special key, `ALL_KEYS`, means 'interest' is registered for all keys.  The same can be accomplished using a regex
of `".\*"`.

The `<gfe:*-interest>` _Key_ and _Regular Expression_ elements support 3 attributes: `durable`, `receive-values`
and `result-policy`.

`durable` indicates whether the 'interest' policy and subscription queue created for the client when the client connects
to 1 or more servers in the cluster is maintained across client sessions.  If the client goes away and comes back,
a "durable" subscription queue on the server(s) for the client is maintained while the client is disconnected,
and when the client reconnects, the client will receive any events that occurred while the client was disconnected
from the servers(s) in the cluster.

A subscription queue on the servers in the cluster is maintained for each `Pool` of connections defined in the client
where subscription has also been "enabled" for that `Pool`.  The subscription queue is used to store, and possibly
conflate, events sent to the client.  If the subscription queue is durable, it persists between client sessions
(i.e. connections), potentially up to a specified timeout (if the client does not return within a given time frame
in order to reduce resource consumption on servers in the cluster).  If the subscription queue is not "durable",
then it will be destroyed when the client disconnects.  All you need to decide is, for your application use case,
is it important for the cache client to receive events while it is disconnected, or is it only important for
the application (cache client) to receive the "latest" events after it reconnects.

The `receive-values` attribute indicates whether or not the entry values are received for create and update events.
If *true*, values are received; if *false*, only invalidation events are received.

And finally, the 'result-policy` is an enumeration of: `KEYS`, `KEYS_VALUE` and `NONE`.  The default is `KEYS_VALUES`.
The `result-policy` controls the initial dump when the client first connects to initialize the local cache,
essentially seeding the client with events for all the entries that match the interest policy.

Client-side interests registration does not do much good without enabling subscription on the `Pool` as mentioned above.
In fact, it is an error to attempt interests registration without subscription enabled.  To do so, you simply...

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:pool ... subscription-enabled="true">
  ...
</gfe:pool>
----

In addition to `subscription-enabled`, can you also set `subscription-ack-interval`,
`subscription-message-tracking-timeout` and `subscription-redundancy`.  `subscription-redundancy` is used to control
how many copies of the subscription queue should be maintained by the servers in the cluster.  If redundancy
is greater than 1, and the "primary" subscription queue (i.e. server) goes down, then a "secondary" subscription queue
will take over, keeping the client from missing events in a HA scenario.

In addition to the `Pool` settings, the server-side Regions use an additional attribute,
`enable-subscription-conflation`, to control the conflation of events that will be sent to the clients.  This can also
help further minimize network traffic and is useful in situations where the application only cares about
the latest value of an entry.  However, in cases where the application is keeping a time series of events that occurred,
conflation is going to hinder that use case.  The default value is *false*.  An example Region configuration
on the server for which the client contains a corresponding client [CACHING_]PROXY Region with interests in Keys
in this server Region, would look like...

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:partitioned-region name="ServerSideRegion" enable-subscription-conflation="true">
  ...
</gfe:partitioned-region>
----

To control the amount of time in seconds that "durable" subscription queue is maintained after a client is disconnected
from the server(s) in the cluster, set the `durable-client-timeout` attribute on the `<gfe:client-cache>` element
like so...

[source,xml]
----
<gfe:client-cache durable-client-timeout="600">
  ...
</gfe:client-cache>
----

A full, in-depth discussion of how client interests work and capabilities is beyond the scope of this document.

Please refer to Pivotal GemFire's documentation on
http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/geode/developing/events/how_client_server_distribution_works.html[Client-to-Server Event Distribution]
for more details.

[[bootstrap:region:json]]
== JSON Support

Pivotal GemFire has support for caching JSON documents in Regions along with the ability to query stored JSON documents
using the GemFire OQL. JSON documents are stored internally as
http://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/pdx/PdxInstance.html[PdxInstance] types
using the http://geode.apache.org/releases/latest/javadoc/org/apache/geode/pdx/JSONFormatter.html[JSONFormatter] class
to perform conversion to and from JSON documents (as a `String`).

_Spring Data GemFire_ provides the `<gfe-data:json-region-autoproxy/>` element to enable a
http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/#aop-introduction[AOP, _Spring_]
component to advise appropriate, proxied Region operations, which effectively encapsulates the `JSONFormatter`,
thereby allowing your applications to work directly with JSON Strings.

In addition, Java objects written to JSON configured Regions will be automatically converted to JSON using Jackson's
`ObjectMapper`. Reading these values back will be returned as a JSON String.

By default, `<gfe-data:json-region-autoproxy/>` performs the conversion for all Regions. To apply this feature
to selected Regions, provide a comma delimited list of Region bean ids via the `region-refs` attribute.
Other attributes include a `pretty-print` flag (defaults to *false*) and `convert-returned-collections`.

Also by default, the results of the `getAll()` and `values()` Region operations will be converted for
configured Regions.  This is done by creating a parallel data structure in local memory. This can incur
significant overhead for large collections, so set the `convert-returned-collections` to *false*
if you would like to disable automatic conversion for these Region operations.

NOTE: Certain Region operations, specifically those that use GemFire's proprietary `Region.Entry` such as:
`entries(boolean)`, `entrySet(boolean)` and `getEntry()` type are not targeted for AOP advice. In addition,
the `entrySet()` method which returns a `Set<java.util.Map.Entry<?, ?>>` is also not affected.

Example configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<gfe-data:json-region-autoproxy region-refs="myJsonRegion" pretty-print="true" convert-returned-collections="false"/>
----

This feature also works seamlessly with `GemfireTemplate` operations, provided that the template is declared
as a _Spring_ bean. Currently, the native `QueryService` operations are not supported.
