SPRING INTEGRATION HAZELCAST SUPPORT
====================================

## HAZELCAST EVENT-DRIVEN INBOUND CHANNEL ADAPTER 

Hazelcast provides distributed data structures such as 

* com.hazelcast.core.IMap, 
* com.hazelcast.core.MultiMap, 
* com.hazelcast.core.IList, 
* com.hazelcast.core.ISet, 
* com.hazelcast.core.IQueue, 
* com.hazelcast.core.ITopic,
* com.hazelcast.core.ReplicatedMap. 

It also provides event listeners in order to listen to the modifications performed on these data structures. 

* com.hazelcast.core.EntryListener<K, V>
* com.hazelcast.core.ItemListener<E>
* com.hazelcast.core.MessageListener<E>

Hazelcast Event-Driven Inbound Channel Adapter listens related cache events and sends event messages to defined channel. Its basic definition is as follows : 
```
   <int-hazelcast:inbound-channel-adapter channel="mapChannel" 
       cache="map" 
       cache-events="UPDATED, REMOVED"
       cache-listening-policy="SINGLE" /> 
```
Basically, Hazelcast Event-Driven Inbound Channel Adapter requires following attributes : 

* **channel :** Specifies channel which message is sent. It is mandatory attribute. 
* **cache :** Specifies the distributed Object reference which is listened. It is mandatory attribute.
* **cache-events :** Specifies cache events which are listened. It is optional attribute and its default value is ADDED. Its supported values are as follows : 

1. Supported cache event types for IMap and MultiMap : ADDED, REMOVED, UPDATED, EVICTED, EVICT_ALL and CLEAR_ALL. 
2. Supported cache event types for ReplicatedMap : ADDED, REMOVED, UPDATED, EVICTED. 
3. Supported cache event types for IList, ISet and IQueue : ADDED, REMOVED. 
4. There is no need to cache event type definition for ITopic. 

* **cache-listening-policy :** Specifies cache listening policy as SINGLE or ALL. It is optional attribute and its default value is SINGLE. Each Hazelcast inbound channel adapter listening same cache object with same cache-events attribute, can receive a single event message or all event messages. If it is ALL, all Hazelcast inbound channel adapters listening same cache object with same cache-events attribute, will receive same event messages. If it is SINGLE, they will receive unique event messages.

Sample namespace and schemaLocation definitions are as follows : 
```
xmlns:int-hazelcast= “http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/hazelcast”

xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/hazelcast
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/hazelcast/spring-integration-hazelcast.xsd”

## HAZELCAST CONTINUOUS QUERY INBOUND CHANNEL ADAPTER 

Hazelcast Continuous Query enables to listen to the modifications performed on specific map entries. Hazelcast Continuous Query Inbound Channel Adapter is an event-driven inbound channel adapter and listens related distributed map events in the light of defined predicate. Its basic definition is as follows : 
```
<int-hazelcast:cq-inbound-channel-adapter 
    channel="cqMapChannel" 
    cache="cqMap" 
    cache-events="UPDATED, REMOVED" 
    predicate="name=TestName AND surname=TestSurname"
    include-value="true"
    cache-listening-policy="SINGLE" /> 
```
Basically, it requires four attributes as follows : 

* **channel :** Specifies channel which message is sent. It is mandatory attribute. 
* **cache :** Specifies distributed Map reference which is listened. It is mandatory attribute. 
* **cache-events :** Specifies cache events which are listened. It is optional attribute with ADDED default value. Supported values are ADDED, REMOVED, UPDATED, EVICTED, EVICT_ALL and CLEAR_ALL. 
* **predicate :** Specifies predicate to listen to the modifications performed on specific map entries. It is mandatory attribute.
* **include-value :** Specifies including of value and oldValue in continuous query result. It is optional attribute with 'true' default value.
* **cache-listening-policy :** Specifies cache listening policy as SINGLE or ALL. It is optional attribute and its default value is SINGLE. Each Hazelcast CQ inbound channel adapter listening same cache object with same cache-events attribute, can receive a single event message or all event messages. If it is ALL, all Hazelcast CQ inbound channel adapters listening same cache object with same cache-events attribute, will receive same event messages. If it is SINGLE, they will receive unique event messages.

Sample definition is as follows : 
```
<int:channel id="cqMapChannel"/> 

<int-hazelcast:cq-inbound-channel-adapter  
    channel="cqMapChannel" 
    cache="cqMap" 
    cache-events="UPDATED, REMOVED" 
    predicate="name=TestName AND surname=TestSurname"
    include-value="true"
    cache-listening-policy="SINGLE"/> 

<bean id="cqMap" factory-bean="instance" factory-method="getMap"> 
 <constructor-arg value="cqMap"/> 
</bean> 

<bean id="instance" class="com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast" 
   factory-method="newHazelcastInstance"> 
 <constructor-arg> 
  <bean class="com.hazelcast.config.Config" /> 
 </constructor-arg> 
</bean> 
```

## HAZELCAST DISTRIBUTED-SQL INBOUND CHANNEL ADAPTER 

Hazelcast allows to run distributed queries on the distributed map. Hazelcast Distributed SQL Inbound Channel Adapter is a poller-driven inbound channel adapter. It runs defined distributed-sql and returns results in the light of iteration type. Its basic definition is as follows : 
```
<int-hazelcast:ds-inbound-channel-adapter  
        channel="dsMapChannel" 
        cache="dsMap"
         iteration-type="ENTRY" 
                 distributed-sql="active=false OR age >= 25 OR name = 'TestName'"> 
 <int:poller fixed-delay="100"/>
</int-hazelcast:ds-inbound-channel-adapter> 
```
Basically, it requires a poller and four attributes such as 

* **channel :** Specifies channel which message is sent. It is mandatory attribute. 
* **cache :** Specifies distributed Map reference which is queried. It is mandatory attribute. 
* **iteration-type :** Specifies result type. Distributed SQL can be run on EntrySet, KeySet, LocalKeySet or Values. It is optional attribute with VALUE default value. Supported values are ENTRY, KEY, LOCAL_KEY and VALUE. 
* **distributed-sql :** Specifies where clause of sql statement. It is mandatory attribute. 

Sample definition is as follows : 
```
<int:channel id="dsMapChannel"/> 

<int-hazelcast:ds-inbound-channel-adapter  
   channel="dsMapChannel" 
   cache="dsMap" 
   iteration-type="ENTRY" 
   distributed-sql="active=false OR age >= 25 OR name = 'TestName'"> 
 <int:poller fixed-delay="100"/>
</int-hazelcast:ds-inbound-channel-adapter> 

<bean id="dsMap" factory-bean="instance" factory-method="getMap"> 
 <constructor-arg value="dsMap"/> 
</bean> 

<bean id="instance" class="com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast" 
   factory-method="newHazelcastInstance"> 
 <constructor-arg> 
  <bean class="com.hazelcast.config.Config" /> 
 </constructor-arg> 
</bean> 
```

## HAZELCAST OUTBOUND CHANNEL ADAPTER 

Hazelcast Outbound Channel Adapter listens its defined channel and writes incoming messages to related distributed cache. It expects one of cache, cache-expression or HazelcastHeaders.CACHE_NAME for distributed object definition. Supported Distributed Objects : IMap, MultiMap, ReplicatedMap, IList, ISet, IQueue and ITopic. Its sample definition is as follows :
```
<int-hazelcast:outbound-channel-adapter channel="mapChannel" cache="distributedMap" key-expression="payload.id" extract-payload="false"/>
```
Basically, it requires the following attributes : 

**channel :** Specifies channel which message is sent.
* **cache :** Specifies distributed object reference. It is optional attribute.
* **cache-expression :** Specifies distributed object via Spring Expression Language(SpEL). It is optional attribute. 
* **key-expression :** Specifies key of K,V pair via Spring Expression Language(SpEL). It is optional attribute and required for just IMap, MultiMap and ReplicatedMap distributed data structures. 
* **extract-payload :** Specifies whole message or just payload to send. It is optional attribute with  **true** default value. If it is true, just payload will be written to distributed object. Otherwise, whole message will be written by covering both message header and payload.

**Sample Definitions :**
```
<int-hazelcast:outbound-channel-adapter channel="mapChannel" cache="distributedMap" key-expression="payload.id" extract-payload="false"/>
```
**OR**
```
<int-hazelcast:outbound-channel-adapter channel="mapChannel" cache-expression="headers['CACHE_HEADER']" key-expression="payload.key" extract-payload="true"/> 
```
By setting distributed object name in the header, messages can be written to different distributed objects via same channel.

**OR**

If **cache** or **cache-expression** attributes are not defined, HazelcastHeaders.CACHE_NAME has to be set in Message.
