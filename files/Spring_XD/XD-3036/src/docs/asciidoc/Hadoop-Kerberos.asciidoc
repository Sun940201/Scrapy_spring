=== Connecting to Kerberized Hadoop

If you have enabled Kerberos security in your Hadoop cluster it is possible to connect XD Shell, hdfs and hdfs-dataset sinks to it.

`hadoop.properties`
[source,text]
----
hadoop.security.authorization=true
spring.hadoop.security.authMethod=kerberos
spring.hadoop.security.userKeytab=/path/to/user.keytab
spring.hadoop.security.userPrincipal=user/host
spring.hadoop.security.namenodePrincipal=hdfs/host@DOMAIN
spring.hadoop.security.rmManagerPrincipal=yarn/host@DOMAIN
----

For both XD Container and XD Shell the config file is `config/hadoop.properties`. 

==== Setting Principals
Principals for `spring.hadoop.security.namenodePrincipal` and `spring.hadoop.security.rmManagerPrincipal` would equal what are in use in Hadoop cluster. 

==== Automatic Login
If you want to avoid running kerberos login commands manually, use `spring.hadoop.security.userKeytab` and `spring.hadoop.security.userPrincipal` propertys respectively. Path to your kerberos keytab file needs to be a fully qualified path in your file system. Essentially this is a model used by internal Hadoop components to do automatic Kerberos logins.
