  The Spring AMQP project applies core Spring concepts to the development
  of AMQP-based messaging solutions. We provide a "template" as a high-level
  abstraction for sending and receiving messages. We also provide support
  for Message-driven POJOs. These libraries facilitate management of AMQP
  resources while promoting the use of dependency injection and declarative
  configuration. In all of these cases, you will see similarities to the
  JMS support in the Spring Framework. The project consists of both Java
  and .NET versions. This manual is dedicated to the Java version. For
  links to the .NET version's manual or any other project-related
  information visit the Spring AMQP project
